## Design Decisions

**No framework** — Vanilla JS was the right choice for a project of this scope. It keeps the bundle lean, demonstrates core fundamentals, and produces code that is straightforward to read and maintain.

**Mobile-first CSS** — Base styles are written for mobile and scaled up with `min-width` media queries. This is the correct approach for modern web development where the majority of traffic is on mobile devices.

**CDN dependencies** — Chart.js and Google Fonts are loaded from CDN. Both are globally cached, production-grade, and faster than self-hosting for a project of this type.

**Simulated data** — The dashboard uses a hardcoded data layer. In a production product this would be replaced with API calls to a backend database.
